1.	How do I approach designing software?
	
  o 	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
A new design skill I have learned while working in the project is time management and maintaining a calm mind while working on a large scale project in very little time.

  o	  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
The design process I have followed was first setting up the window environment along with the shader. The next step I set up the creating the meshes along with drawing them into the graphics card. After that I set up controllers and lighting logic and lastly setting up the textures.

  o	  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
Developing any project in checks was a skill I have learned in my previous classes form project management. It is in the lines of agile workflow. As I have stated above creating the environment of starter code and having a working build first we can have an environment with little to no errors.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

  o	  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  
The most challenging aspect in creating a 3D scene was creating the shapes. What I found is creating a rhythm and writhing down the point in paper and identifying the x, y, z corrodents became a faster way in creating the shapes blindly by simply looking at the point entered 3 plotted points before, it is very easy to get lost eventually becoming a waste of time. 

  o	  How did iteration factor into your development?
Working on the different aspects to openGL lighting, controller, textures, and lighting, I believe it was a benefit having them split up into different module. But, with all the information that was required it was a challenge to remember the different functions and methods to develop the final product. Though the short deadlines did teach a valuable lesson I can bring over in the time I become employed. 

  o	  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
The approach I have take to complete the milestones was by watching YouTube example videos that best explain the topic of the week. Then reading the course material to expand my understanding and then continuing to the project. understanding that all the project that I have worked on through the week build off each other I simply think of the modifications I need to do to implement the add on it being the lighting, textures, and controllers. Out of all the projects I had the most difficult time with textures.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  o	  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  
In the realm of software development there is always a form of math that needs to partake in. Learning computational graphics this term has taught me many valuable skills and problem solving was the major key. going over documentation in the learn openGL was very vague in my opinion did not help a whole lot in times. Watching videos and articles examples had a better benefit. That being said, skill I found useful is information gathering and researching helped me successes in the previous project.  

  o	  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In the near future, upon getting onboarded in a new company, having this exposure of graphics and visualizations may come in handy when implanting them into a professional project that dose require a form of visual graphics. But the core concept that is deemed most useful is understanding the framework that can be translated into different platforms and the room of experiments.
